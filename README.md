# note-taker
The goal of this project was to create notes that will save to a JSON database file called db.json as well as recall them by displaying them on a html page hosted on a localhost server.
This program heavily relies on Express JS for hosting/pathing using routers, GET, POST and even DELETE requests.
We used DOM traversal and the original index.js mainly to showcase in the Front-End portion of then bootcamp, integrating them and adding in a Back-End.
